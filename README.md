# HOA
## HOA calculus : virial analysis + clausius-clapeyron analysis
### Inputs : see example inputs. This file can have some variation like only the datas for adsorption, no title/header just numbers. You can also copy two columns on your clipboard, first column with relative pressure and second column with quantity adsorbed (mmol/g). Be aware of the order, lower temperatures before higher temperatures.
